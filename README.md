# Open Source Game Clones

This is a source of [http://osgameclones.com][1]. Feel free to submit pull
requests to add new games and improve information about those already in the
database.

## How

Check `games.yaml` out. All information is inside, and you should more or less
understand what's going on by reading it. I'll add more documentation later.
