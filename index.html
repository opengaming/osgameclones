  <h1>Open Source Game Clones</h1>

  <p>
    This site tries to gather <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> 
    or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software">source-available</a> 
    remakes of great old games in one place. If you think that
    something is missing from the list - please go to
    our <a href="http://github.com/opengaming/osgameclones/">GitHub
    repository</a> and create an issue or even a pull request!
  </p>
  <p>
    Since all these projects are open-source you can help them and make this
    world a better place. Or at least you can play something to appreciate the
    effort people put in them.
